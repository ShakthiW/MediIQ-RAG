The heart has many vessels and can operate when some are blocked but a Sudden Cardiac\\nArrest in like a complete electrical blackout.\\nWhy Do We Need Automatic External Defibrillators (AEDs)?\\nThe only definitive treatment for victims of Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) is defibrillation. Sudden\\nCardiac Arrest (SCA) usually happens without warning and the majority of people have no previously\\nrecognized symptoms of heart disease. For the best chance of survival from Sudden Cardiac Arrest\\n(SCA) caused by Ventricular Fibrillation (VF), Automatic External Defibrillators (AED) should be used\\nwithin the first 3-5 minutes after collapse. Currently less than 5% of victims survive largely because\\na Defibrillator does not arrive in time. An AED can increase the survival rate to 50% and in some\\nsituations like commercial airlines around 70%.\\nJust as seat belts or airbags do not save every life in a traffic accident, an AED defibrillator will not\\nsave every person who suffers a Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) however many lives could be saved if\\nmore people had access to an Automatic External Defibrillator (AED).\\nWho can use an AED?\\nAED’s were designed to be used by non-medical people with little or no previous experience or\\ninstruction.\\nIn a perfect world everyone should have CPR and AED training, however modern AEDs are designed\\nto be used by any motivated bystander, regardless of training. The devices advise the user about\\nhow to apply the device and whether or not to administer a shock. Most of the time, the AED will\\nadvise the user with voice prompts to administer CPR, depending on the needs of the victim,\\nhowever all AED’s supplied by Australian Defibrillators have a voice coach to instruct you during\\nthese vital minutes.\\nFrom the time that the event occurs to the time that medical help\\narrives is critical. The instructions from the AED are keeping you\\nproductive and giving the patient the very best chance of survival until\\nhelp, which is on the way, has arrived. The national average response\\ntime for an ambulance in Australia is 10-12 minutes and even longer in\\nrural or remote areas. This is the critical time when defibrillation is\\nneeded for the patient to survive.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='ce20278d-6efc-417d-a492-0ad13c05dd6e', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '4', 'file_name': 'Automated External Defibrillator (1).pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/shakthiraveen/Desktop/AI-Driven.nosync/RAG-new/data/Automated External Defibrillator (1).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 574267, 'creation_date': '2024-04-10', 'last_modified_date': '2024-04-10'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text=\"How Does an Automated External Defibrillator Work?\\nAutomated external defibrillators (AEDs) are lightweight, battery-operated, portable devices that are\\neasy to use. Sticky pads with sensors (called electrodes) are attached to the chest of the person who\\nis having sudden cardiac arrest (SCA).\\nThe electrodes send information about the person's heart rhythm to a computer in the AED. The\\ncomputer analyzes the heart rhythm to find out whether an electric shock is needed. If a shock is\\nneeded, the AED uses voice prompts to tell you when to give the shock, and the electrodes deliver it.\\nUsing an AED to shock the heart within minutes of the start of SCA may restore a normal heart\\nrhythm. Every minute counts. Each minute of SCA leads to a 10 percent reduction in survival.\\nTraining To Use an Automated External Defibrillator:\\nLearning how to use an AED and taking a CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) course are helpful.\\nHowever, if trained personnel aren't available, untrained people also can use an AED to help save\\nsomeone's life.\\nSome people are afraid to use an AED to help save someone's life.\\nThey're worried that something might go wrong and that they might\\nbe sued.\\nFacility owners who are thinking about buying an AED should\\nprovide initial and ongoing training to likely rescuers (usually\\npeople who work in the facility). Also, it's important to properly\\nmaintain an AED and notify local emergency officials of its location.\\nHow To Use an Automated External Defibrillator:\\nBefore using an automated external defibrillator (AED) on someone who you think is having sudden\\ncardiac arrest (SCA), check him or her.\\nIf you see a person suddenly collapse and pass out, or if you find a person already unconscious,\\nconfirm that the person can't respond. Shout at and shake the person to make sure he or she isn't\\nsleeping.\\nNever shake an infant or young child. Instead, you can pinch the child to try to wake him or her up.\\nCall emergency or have someone else call emergency. If two rescuers are present, one can provide\\nCPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) while the other calls emergency and gets the AED.\\nCheck the person's breathing and pulse. If breathing and pulse are absent or irregular, prepare to\\nuse the AED as soon as possible. (SCA causes death if it's not treated within minutes.)\\nIf no one knows how long the person has been unconscious, or if an AED isn't readily available, do 2\\nminutes of CPR. Then use the AED (if you have one) to check the person.\\nAfter you use the AED, or if you don't have an AED, give CPR until emergency medical help arrives\\nor until the person begins to move. Try to limit pauses in CPR.\\nAfter 2 minutes of CPR, you can use the AED again to check the person's heart rhythm and give\\nanother shock, if needed.

The heart has many vessels and can operate when some are blocked but a Sudden Cardiac\\nArrest in like a complete electrical blackout.\\nWhy Do We Need Automatic External Defibrillators (AEDs)?\\nThe only definitive treatment for victims of Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) is defibrillation. Sudden\\nCardiac Arrest (SCA) usually happens without warning and the majority of people have no previously\\nrecognized symptoms of heart disease. For the best chance of survival from Sudden Cardiac Arrest\\n(SCA) caused by Ventricular Fibrillation (VF), Automatic External Defibrillators (AED) should be used\\nwithin the first 3-5 minutes after collapse. Currently less than 5% of victims survive largely because\\na Defibrillator does not arrive in time. An AED can increase the survival rate to 50% and in some\\nsituations like commercial airlines around 70%.\\nJust as seat belts or airbags do not save every life in a traffic accident, an AED defibrillator will not\\nsave every person who suffers a Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) however many lives could be saved if\\nmore people had access to an Automatic External Defibrillator (AED).\\nWho can use an AED?\\nAED’s were designed to be used by non-medical people with little or no previous experience or\\ninstruction.\\nIn a perfect world everyone should have CPR and AED training, however modern AEDs are designed\\nto be used by any motivated bystander, regardless of training. The devices advise the user about\\nhow to apply the device and whether or not to administer a shock. Most of the time, the AED will\\nadvise the user with voice prompts to administer CPR, depending on the needs of the victim,\\nhowever all AED’s supplied by Australian Defibrillators have a voice coach to instruct you during\\nthese vital minutes.\\nFrom the time that the event occurs to the time that medical help\\narrives is critical. The instructions from the AED are keeping you\\nproductive and giving the patient the very best chance of survival until\\nhelp, which is on the way, has arrived. The national average response\\ntime for an ambulance in Australia is 10-12 minutes and even longer in\\nrural or remote areas.

Sticky pads with sensors (called electrodes) are attached to the chest of the person who\\nis having sudden cardiac arrest (SCA).\\nThe electrodes send information about the person's heart rhythm to a computer in the AED. The\\ncomputer analyzes the heart rhythm to find out whether an electric shock is needed. If a shock is\\nneeded, the AED uses voice prompts to tell you when to give the shock, and the electrodes deliver it.\\nUsing an AED to shock the heart within minutes of the start of SCA may restore a normal heart\\nrhythm. Every minute counts. Each minute of SCA leads to a 10 percent reduction in survival.\\nTraining To Use an Automated External Defibrillator:\\nLearning how to use an AED and taking a CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) course are helpful.\\nHowever, if trained personnel aren't available, untrained people also can use an AED to help save\\nsomeone's life.\\nSome people are afraid to use an AED to help save someone's life.\\nThey're worried that something might go wrong and that they might\\nbe sued.\\nFacility owners who are thinking about buying an AED should\\nprovide initial and ongoing training to likely rescuers (usually\\npeople who work in the facility). Also, it's important to properly\\nmaintain an AED and notify local emergency officials of its location.\\nHow To Use an Automated External Defibrillator:\\nBefore using an automated external defibrillator (AED) on someone who you think is having sudden\\ncardiac arrest (SCA), check him or her.\\nIf you see a person suddenly collapse and pass out, or if you find a person already unconscious,\\nconfirm that the person can't respond. Shout at and shake the person to make sure he or she isn't\\nsleeping.\\nNever shake an infant or young child. Instead, you can pinch the child to try to wake him or her up.\\nCall emergency or have someone else call emergency. If two rescuers are present, one can provide\\nCPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) while the other calls emergency and gets the AED.\\nCheck the person's breathing and pulse. If breathing and pulse are absent or irregular, prepare to\\nuse the AED as soon as possible. (SCA causes death if it's not treated within minutes.)\\nIf no one knows how long the person has been unconscious, or if an AED isn't readily available, do 2\\nminutes of CPR. Then use the AED (if you have one) to check the person.\\nAfter you use the AED, or if you don't have an AED, give CPR until emergency medical help arrives\\nor until the person begins to move. Try to limit pauses in CPR.\\nAfter 2 minutes of CPR, you can use the AED again to check the person's heart rhythm and give\\nanother shock, if needed.

For someone with a food\\nallergy, eating or swallowing even a tiny amount of a particular food can cause symptoms such as\\nskin rash, nausea, vomiting, cramping, and diarrhea. Because the body is reacting to something that\\nis otherwise harmless, this type of allergic reaction is often called a hypersensitivity reaction. Rarely,\\na severe allergic reaction can cause a life-threatening set of symptoms called anaphylaxis, or\\nanaphylactic shock.\\nAlthough a large percentage of people believe they have a food allergy, few adults and children,\\nmainly younger than 6 years, have true food allergies. The rest have what is known as food\\nintolerance, an undesirable reaction to a food that does not involve the immune system.\\nIt is easy to confuse food intolerance with food allergy because they can have similar symptoms.\\nWith food intolerance, however, a person usually gets only mild symptoms such as an upset\\nstomach.\\nA common example of food intolerance is lactose intolerance, a condition in which a person is\\nmissing a certain enzyme necessary to digest dairy proteins. The result is loose stools, gas,\\nand nausea after consuming dairy products such as milk or cheese.\\nAnother example of food intolerance is reaction to MSG. MSG, or monosodium glutamate, is a\\nwhite-colored additive used to enhance the flavor of food. It is a fermented mixture of glutamic\\nacid, sodium, and water and is used mainly in Asian cooking. Over the last decades, side\\neffects from MSG have been related to its use in Chinese food and referred to as the Chinese\\nrestaurant syndrome. In this syndrome, MSG was suggested as the cause of the symptoms\\nfollowing a Chinese meal. In 1995, a new term was coined, the MSG symptom complex, to\\ninclude all the reactions that were reported to be related to MSG. These reactions are not a\\ntrue food allergy, and the exact cause of the reactions is unknown.\\nFood Allergy Causes', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='747a9078-c8ad-4de3-b267-1e9281d047f7', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '2', 'file_name': 'EHSDB.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/shakthiraveen/Desktop/AI-Driven.nosync/RAG-new/data/EHSDB.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 234869, 'creation_date': '2024-04-10', 'last_modified_date': '2024-04-10'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='An allergic reaction occurs when the body\\'s immune system overreacts to an allergen, in this case a\\nfood protein.\\nThe white blood cells produce an antibody to this allergen, called immunoglobulin E or IgE.\\nWhen this antibody comes in contact with the particular food protein, it promotes\\nproduction and release of certain chemicals called \"mediators.\" Histamine is an example\\nof a mediator.\\nThese mediators act on various parts of the body, mainly the skin, throat, airways,\\nintestines, and heart.\\nThe effects of the mediators on organs and other cells cause the symptoms of the allergic\\nreaction.\\nAny food has the potential to trigger an allergic reaction, but a few foods account for most food\\nallergies.

The actual temperature is just one factor when a\\nperson decides to work, play, or exercise in the heat. The heat\\nindex adds humidity to the equation since sweat cannot\\nevaporate if the water content in the air (humidity) is high. If the\\nair holds as much water as it can there is no place for sweat to\\ngo, and evaporation cannot cool the body.\\nTo avoid heat-related illnesses, avoid working or exercising in extreme heat. If it is required, to avoid\\ndehydration and other complications, take frequent breaks to get out of the heat and drink plenty of\\nfluids to replenish fluid lost via sweat. \\n Early signs of heat-related illnesses include light-headedness, weakness, and nausea. It is\\nimportant to get out of the heat, cool off, and re-hydrate immediately to avoid heat-related problems\\nsuch as heat exhaustion and heat. \\nHow much water should I drink in hot weather?\\nIt is hard to gauge how much water is lost through sweat, and\\nthe thirst mechanism may not be sensitive enough to remind a\\nperson to drink enough. In general, the kidneys are a good\\nguide to whether there is enough water in the body. If the body\\nis dehydrated, the kidneys will try to hold on to as much water\\nas possible. Symptoms and signs of the kidneys preserving\\nwater are decreased urine production, urine concentrated in\\ncolour, and a strong urine odour.

It is very\\nimportant to get immediate medical attention if any of the following symptoms occur.\\n1. Hives\\n2. Swelling lips, tongue, throat and or eyes\\n3. Slurred speech\\n4. Coughing, difficulty breathing, wheezing\\n5. Numbness and cramping\\n6. Nausea and vomiting\\n7. Anxiety, confusion, or unconsciousness\\nIf you can, try to identify the snake, or take note of it’s appearance.\\nThis will help doctors determine if the snake is poisonous. If you can’t\\nfind it, don’t bother looking for it. Don’t give the person anything to eat or drink, especially alcoholic\\nbeverages. If you think the snake was poisonous then you may apply a *light* tourniquet 2-4 inches\\nabove and below the bite area.\\nMost snakes are not poisonous, and poisonous snakes are not found in Maine or Alaska, but you\\nshould still have these bites inspected so you can prevent the spread of bacteria and infection.\\nGetting medical attention quickly is important because the anti-venom serums are ineffective if they\\nare not administered within 12 hours.\\nBee Stings:\\nIf someone is stung by a bee, the first step is to remove the stinger if it\\nis still present in the skin (this only occurs with the honeybee, who dies\\nshortly after stinging.). This should be done by using tweezers, or, if no\\ntweezers are available, scrape it out with a fingernail, or card. It is\\nimportant never to squeeze a stinger when removing it, as more venom\\nwill be injected into the bite. Then wash the bite area with an\\nantibacterial soap then you may apply an antibacterial cream if you\\nwant. After the area has been washed, apply ice wrapped in a cloth or\\nin a bag to the skin (do not apply ice directly as it may freeze the skin and cause more damage), the\\nice will help minimize the pain and swelling.\\nIf you are not allergic to bee stings, you may experience anything from a mild irritation and itching to\\nthe swelling of the entire part of the body that was stung.\\nIf you’re allergic to bee stings, you could be subject to a very serious (although rare) allergic\\nreaction known as Anaphylactic shock. This reaction can be life threatening and should be taken\\nvery seriously. All cases of anaphylactic shock and suspected shock should report to the emergency\\nroom as soon as possible.

These syringes are injected into the front of the thigh, or a\\nmuscle and work to constrict the blood vessels before more damage can be done.

Because bee stings can\\nhappen at almost any time during the spring, summer, and early fall it is important to keep several\\nkits on hand, especially if medical help is out of reach, for example camping trips, hikes, and on\\nvacations where territory and bugs are unfamiliar. Keep kits at home and in the car, and if your child\\nis allergic, leave a kit with the school nurse. Although this drug may stop a reaction and make you\\nseem alright it is very important to go to your doctor anyway as soon as possible to be sure. In some\\ncases the epinephrine is not enough and intravenous fluids or other treatments are needed. ALL\\ncases of anaphylactic shock, or suspected cases should report to the emergency room immediately!\\nThe longer you wait the more damaging the effects.\\nIf you or someone you know or live with is at risk of going into anaphylactic shock it is important to\\nknow how to use the syringes.

It is also advised that a Medic Alert\\nbracelet or necklace be worn.\\nSigns of anaphylactic shock:\\nReactions of this kind usually occur seconds or minutes after\\nthe sting is received, although a few cases have not reacted for\\nup to 12 hours.

For food allergies and insect bites this may be particularly\\ndifficult as food is presented in many different ways, and insects are\\nall around you. For some people immunotherapy is key. This therapy\\nintroduces small amounts of the allergen to the person and increases\\nthe dose over time. This is a lengthy treatment and takes at least five\\nyears, however it can be an invaluable form of protection as it is\\nalmost 100% effective.\\nIf your allergy involves bee stings it is important to note a few things\\nabout the bees. Honeybees can only sting you once, their stingers get stuck in the skin and\\nthey must tear away that part of their abdomen to escape. The bee dies shortly after delivering\\nthe sting. Luckily honeybees are not aggressive, like some of their relatives, wasps, hornets,\\nand yellow jackets tend to be, these bees will only sting if they are disturbed or injured. The\\nmost common sting from these bees is when they are stepped on. The best way to avoid that is\\nto keep shoes on while walking or playing in areas where honeybees forage, such as clover\\npatches and flowerbeds.\\nAnother few things to note about bees (and other stinging insects), is that they are attracted to\\nbright colors and strong scents. Insects seeking nectar are drawn towards bright colors, and\\nperfumes. If you are allergic to these stings it is recommended that you avoid hairspray,\\nperfumes, and colognes and, in the case of bees, bug spray. Bug spray will not deter bees, and\\nsince the scent is strong they may even be attracted. You should also avoid areas where food is\\nopen to the environment such as garbage cans, dumps, picnic areas etc. Another interesting\\nfact about bees and color, is that black is an irritant to bees, while blue is a comforting color, it\\nis important to remember this when selecting bathing attire\\nShareSubscribe to our mailing\\nlist\\nemail address\\nSubscribe\\nHow t o Deal with Minor Insect Bite How t o Deal with Minor Insect Bite …… How t o Treat Insect Bites & Stings : How t o Treat Insect Bites & Stings : ……\\n0 comments Sort by  \\nFacebook Comments PluginOldest\\nAdd a comment...', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='1c974c94-0103-4411-ad4e-d9a9924ad9e5', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '1', 'file_name': 'LICE.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/shakthiraveen/Desktop/AI-Driven.nosync/RAG-new/data/LICE.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 191642, 'creation_date': '2024-04-10', 'last_modified_date': '2024-04-10'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='ehsdb\\nHome  EHS Guidelines  Downloads  Case Studies  Webinars  Contact Us  Search\\nLice :\\nWhat are lice?\\nLice are tiny insects that live on humans and feed on blood.

It needs to be treated right away to\\nprevent brain damage and death.\\nWhat causes meningitis?\\nViral meningitis is caused by viruses. Bacterial meningitis is caused by bacteria.\\nMeningitis can also be caused by other organisms and some medicines, but this is rare.\\nMeningitis is contagious. The germs that cause it can be passed from one person to another through\\ncoughing and sneezing and through close contact.\\nSymptoms\\nIn both cases the symptoms are flu-like, and may not appear all at once.
